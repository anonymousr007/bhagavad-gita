# Bhagavad Gita

## Chapter 1 : Arjun Viṣhād Yog [Lamenting the Consequences of War]

> The Bhagavad Gita, or the song of God, was revealed by Lord Shree Krishna to Arjun on the threshold of the epic war of Mahabharata. A decisive battle between two sets of cousins, the Kauravas and the Pandavas, was just about to commence on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. A detailed account of the reasons that led to such a colossal war; is given under Introduction-The Setting of the Bhagavad Gita.
>
> The Bhagavad Gita is primarily a conversation between Lord Shree Krishna and Arjun. However, the first chapter begins with a dialogue between King Dhritarashtra and his minister Sanjay. Dhritarashtra being blind, could not leave his palace in Hastinapur but was eager to know the ongoings of the battlefield.
>
> Sanjay was a disciple of Sage Ved Vyas, the author of the epic Mahabharata and several other Hindu scriptures. Sage Ved Vyas possessed a mystic ability to see and hear events occurring in distant places. He had bestowed upon Sanjay the miraculous power of distant vision. Therefore, Sanjay could see and hear, what transpired on the battleground of Kurukshetra, and gave a first-hand account to King Dhritarashtra while still being in his palace.

### Chapter 1 : Verse 1

> धृतराष्ट्र उवाच |
> 
> धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे समवेता युयुत्सवः |
>
> मामकाः पाण्डवाश्चैव किमकुर्वत सञ्जय ||1||

* dhṛitarāśhtraḥ uvācha—Dhritarashtra said;
* dharma-kṣhetre—the land of dharma; 
* kuru-kṣhetre—at Kurukshetra; 
* samavetāḥ—having gathered; 
* yuyutsavaḥ—desiring to fight; 
* māmakāḥ—my sons; 
* pāṇḍavāḥ—the sons of Pandu; 
* cha—and; eva—certainly; 
* kim—what; 
* akurvata—did they do; 
* sañjaya—Sanjay;

> BG 1.1: Dhritarashtra said: O Sanjay, after gathering on the holy field of Kurukshetra, and desiring to fight, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do?

> The two armies had gathered on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, well prepared to fight a war that was inevitable. Still, in this verse, King Dhritarashtra asked Sanjay, what his sons and his brother Pandu’s sons were doing on the battlefield? It was apparent that they would fight, then why did he ask such a question?
> 
> The blind King Dhritarashtra’s fondness for his own sons had clouded his spiritual wisdom and deviated him from the path of virtue. He had usurped the kingdom of Hastinapur from the rightful heirs; the Pandavas, sons of his brother Pandu. Feeling guilty of the injustice he had done towards his nephews, his conscience worried him about the outcome of this battle.
> 
> The words dharma kṣhetre, the land of dharma (virtuous conduct) used by Dhritarashtra depict the dilemma he was experiencing.  Kurukshetra is described as kurukṣhetraṁ deva yajanam in the Shatapath Brahman, the Vedic textbook detailing rituals. It means “Kurukshetra is the sacrificial arena of the celestial gods.” Hence, it was regarded as the sacred land that nourished dharma. 
> 
> Dhritarashtra feared that the holy land might influence the minds of his sons. If it aroused the faculty of discrimination, they might turn away from killing their cousins and negotiate a truce. A peaceful settlement meant that the Pandavas would continue being a hindrance for them. He felt great displeasure at these possibilities, instead preferred that this war transpires. He was uncertain of the consequences of the war, yet desired to determine the fate of his sons. Therefore, he asked Sanjay about the activities of the two armies on the battleground.

### Chapter 1 : Verse 2

> सञ्जय उवाच ।
>
> दृष्ट्वा तु पाण्डवानीकं व्यूढं दुर्योधनस्तदा ।
>
> आचार्यमुपसङ्गम्य राजा वचनमब्रवीत् ।। 2।।

* sanjayaḥ uvācha—Sanjay said;
* dṛiṣhṭvā—on observing;
* tu—but;
* pāṇḍava-anīkam—the Pandava army;
* vyūḍham—standing in a military formation;
* duryodhanaḥ—King Duryodhan;
* tadā—then;
* āchāryam—teacher;
* upasaṅgamya—approached;
* rājā—the king;
* vachanam—words;
* abravīt—spoke;

> BG 1.2: Sanjay said: On observing the Pandava army standing in military formation, King Duryodhan approached his teacher Dronacharya, and said the following words.

> Sanjay understood Dhritarashtra’s concern, who wanted an assurance that the battle would eventuate. Sanjay tried to allay his worry by informing that the Pandava army was standing in a military formation, ready for battle. Then he moved on to tell him what his son Duryodhana was doing on the battlefield.
>
> As King Dhritarashtra was blind, his eldest son Duryodhana virtually ruled the kingdom of Hastinapur. In the Mahabharata, he is described as very rude, egoistic, evil and cruel by nature. Since his childhood, he had a strong dislike for the Pandavas and left no opportunity to demean them. He was aware that to rule over the entire kingdom of Hastinapur unchallenged he needed to eliminate them. However, standing on the battlefield, when he saw the large Pandava army, he was baffled.  He had underestimated the Pandavas, the extent of military might they had gathered was way beyond his expectation.
>
> Duryodhana approached his guru Dronacharya with the pretense of offering respect, but his actual purpose was to palliate his own nervousness. His move towards his guru also reveals that the mammoth military formation of the Pandava army unnerved him and he was now fearful of the outcome of this war.
> 
> The next nine verses are spoken by Duryodhan.

### Chapter 1 : Verse 3

> पश्यैतां पाण्डुपुत्राणामाचार्य महतीं चमूम् ।
> 
> व्यूढां द्रुपदपुत्रेण तव शिष्येण धीमता ।। 3।।

* paśhya—behold;
* etām—this;
* pāṇḍu-putrāṇām—of the sons of Pandu;
* āchārya—respected teacher;
* mahatīm—mighty;
* chamūm—army;
* vyūḍhām—arrayed in a military formation;
* drupada-putreṇa—son of Drupad,Dhrishtadyumna;
* tava—by your;
* śhiṣhyeṇa—disciple;
* dhī-matā—intelligent

> BG 1.3: Duryodhan said: Respected teacher! Behold the mighty army of the sons of Pandu, so expertly arrayed for battle by your own gifted disciple, the son of Drupad.

> Duryodhana asked Dronacharya to look at the skillfully arranged military phalanx of the Pandava army led by their commander-in-chief Dhristadyumna, King Dhrupad’s son. He was also one of Dronacharya’s pupils. Duryodhana was subtly reminding his teacher of a mistake he had committed in the past.
> 
> Many years back, Dronacharya along with the Pandavas had defeated King Drupad in a battle and took away half his kingdom. To avenge his defeat, Drupad performed a sacrifice to beget a son. Dhristadyumna was born out of that sacrificial fire, with a boon that he would kill Dronacharya in the future. Even though Dronacharya was aware, when he was approached for Dhristadyumna’s military training, he very humbly accepted and imparted all his knowledge impartially to his pupil.
> 
> Duryodhana was reminding Dronacharya that even though Dhristadyumna was his pupil, he was also Drupad’s son, with a boon to kill him. He wanted to ensure that as in the past, Dhronacharya should not become lenient towards his pupils, now that, they were on the battlefield.
